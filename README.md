# Backend Software Development Project

I am undertaking this #backend project as part of the Software Development Bootcamp with Northcoders. The project, "NC News API", uses psql to setup and database of news articles (think Reddit), and HTTP endpoints to make data available to a client. In a few weeks I'll be doing a #frontend project to provide a webpage for this.

# Setup

This project is being completed using:

-   node for the Javascript software
-   jest and supertest for testing
-   psql for the database

I'm obviously keeping my local environment secure and not sharing to this public repo, so if you are wanting to use this code you'll need to set up your own .env files for each of the 'test' and 'dev' databases e.g.:

-   .env.test `PGDATABASE=database_name_here`
